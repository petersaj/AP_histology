MATLAB toolbox for viewing, aligning Allen CCF mouse atlas, and annotating slice histology images.

Inspiration from SHARP-Track by Philip Shamash (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/447995v1).

# Installation 
* download the Allen CCF mouse atlas [download here](https://osf.io/fv7ed/) *
* clone this repository
* add both the CCF mouse atlas and repository to the matlab path
* [The npy-matlab repository](http://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab)

*(note on where these files came from: they are a re-formatted version of [the original atlas](http://download.alleninstitute.org/informatics-archive/current-release/mouse_ccf/annotation/ccf_2017/), which has been [processed with this script](https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF/blob/master/setup_utils.m))

# Usage
See the [wiki](https://github.com/petersaj/AP_histology/wiki) for instructions on use



# Major change log
2026-02-23 - v2 released. Saved files before this point are incompatible - to use old files, use repo before this date.

2024-02-16 - Split re-order/flip GUIs: re-ordering is now a simpler click interface

2023-11-02 - Created menu GUI for easier interfacing re-structured/improve much of the code, improved auto-align
